You enter the next room, not knowing what to expect.

Upon entering, you discover piles of books, dusty scrolls and ancient scriptures from long ago.

It Seems you've found an old libray. 

In the heart of the library, a majestic oak reading table stands beneath a chandelier, its candles long extinguished.

To the left of the room is a sprawling labyrinth of bookshelves, each one as towering above the rest of the room,
touching the ceiling above. 

To the right of you, you notice an alchemists workshop. perhaps wizards once inhabited this place. 


What will you do?
