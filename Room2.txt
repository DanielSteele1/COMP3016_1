
        You find yourself in a dimly lit blacksmiths chamber.
        
        The air is heavy with the scent of burning coal, and the flickering light of a forge casts dancing 
        shadows on the stone walls.

        In one corner, a sturdy workbench holds an assortment of tools, and a rack displays an array of weapons
        and armor.

        The blacksmith's anvil stands prominently in the center of the room, bearing the marks of countless creations.

        To your left, a narrow archway leads to the main forge area, where molten metal glows with an orange hue.

        To your right, a wooden door creaks softly in the draft, hinting at an exit.


        What will you do?
