
        You leave the blacksmiths chamber, only to find yourself inside some mysterious ruins.
        
        It's crumbling pillars strut out from the ground, it's purpose lost to time.
  
        to the left of you, there's a creeky wooden bridge leading you over a body of deep water.

        to the right of you, there's a stone door with ancient text written on it, but it's locked.
       

        What will you do?
