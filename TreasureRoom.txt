
* SECRET FOUND - TREASURE VAULT * 

As you run in the door to escape the dense fog, you enter a room gleaming with light.

To you're delight, there's stacks upon stacks of gold, diamonds and jewels here, with golden light bouncing around the room.

Even the floor itself is made of what looks like solid gold!

This must be the room mentioned in the note you found!  It's a treasure vault! 

You decide to take some treasure yourself, filling up your pockets with as much as you can carry. 

Also, you notice another passage. luckily, it takes you back to the library, away from the fog.
