As you climb up the neverending stairs to the top,  you notice something. 

Natural light. 

You feel close to your escape, excited to think that maybe, just maybe, you might get out of this place alive. 

Unfortunatly, as you finally get to the top, you realise it's not over just yet. 

There are only 3 doors in front of you. Only one leads to freedom. 

The left door is fiery, made of dark bedrock with streaks of what looks like lava, illuminating the rest of the room.

The Middle door is made of earth and moss, with luscious vegatation, vines and even fruit growing in the entrance. 

The Right door is pure darkness, with dark ghostly figures dissapearing and reappearing around the door. 
This one makes you feel particularly on-edge. 

What will you do?
